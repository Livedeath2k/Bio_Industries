# Bio Industries

Main feature of the mod is to introduce a way to produce raw-wood and adds a lot of uses for that wood you produce.
Core:
Bio Nursery - Produce Seeds and Seedlings
Bio Farm – Grow Raw wood from Seedlings
You can Plans seedlings and they will grow into trees. Depending on the Terrain type they might or might not grow. Deserts have a lower change and Grass has a much higher change. 
You can use fertilizer and change the terrain type to Grass, so your trees will grow if you’re in a desert.

There’s probably stuff I’m forgetting, but that’s what I can think of.
